# [deploymentdelete] ðŸš®

This utility deletes deployments older than 7 days for Cloudflare Pages.

## Installation

```sh
npm install -g deploymentdelete
```

## CLI Usage

```sh
DeploymentDelete -e example@account.com -i accountId -k accountKey
```

DeploymentDelete will now delete deployments associated with all the projects in
the account using the Cloudflare API older than 7 days. You might need to re-run
this several times as it only deletes 40 deployments at a time.

> **Note**
>
> This will not delete your last running deployment.

## Options

```sh
  -V, --version        output the version number
  -e, --Email <Email>  Cloudflare Account E-mail.
  -i, --ID <ID>        Cloudflare Account ID.
  -k, --Key <Key>      Cloudflare API key.
  -h, --help           display help for command
```

## Worker

You can also publish it as a worker:

```sh
wrangler publish
```
